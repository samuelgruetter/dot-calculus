Dependent Object Types (DOT)
----------------------------

The DOT calculus proposes a new foundation for Scala's type system.

DOT has been presented at the FOOL 2012 workshop
([PDF](http://lampwww.epfl.ch/~amin/dot/fool.pdf)).

We now have several mechanized type safety proofs.
This repo implements [the wadlerfest model](https://github.com/samuelgruetter/dot-calculus.git)
in Coq, based on previous work in the
[namin/dot](https://github.com/namin/dot) and
[TiarkRompf/minidot](https://github.com/TiarkRompf/minidot) repos.
